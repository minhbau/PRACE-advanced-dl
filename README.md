# PRACE course: Introduction to High-Performance Machine Learning (2nd day)

For the first session in this course we will use the [Cartesius supercomputer](https://userinfo.surfsara.nl/systems/cartesius) hosted at SURFsara. You will need to connect to them through the ssh protocol (natively installed on Linux and Mac).

For Windows users, we recommend to connect via ssh using [MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/) or, on Windows 10, using the [native bash environment](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/install_guide)

## Connect to Cartesius

To connect to Cartesius, please open a terminal and use the following command:

    ssh ptcXXX@cartesius.surfsara.nl

Here "ptcXXX" is the login name that you received via email. Type in the password you received together with your login name and press Enter (note that the cursor may not move while introducing the password, but the typing will succeed).

This access to Cartesius is made available for duration of the course and at most one week after its finalization.

## Running Jupyter notebooks

Please refer to the repository of the [introduction part](https://github.com/sara-nl/PRACE-intro-dl) and find the information in the part "Preparation for the hands-on sessions" of the README file.
